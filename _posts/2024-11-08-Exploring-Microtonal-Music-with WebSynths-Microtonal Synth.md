In my journey through microtonal music, I recently discovered [WebSynths Microtonal](https://www.websynths.com/microtonal/)—an innovative web-based synthesizer dedicated to microtonal tuning. WebSynths, developed by musician and programmer **Garth Paine**, allows users to break free from the constraints of traditional Western tuning and dive into a world of alternative pitches and tonal systems.

**About the Creator:**
Garth Paine, a prominent figure in the electronic music and sound art community, created WebSynths Microtonal in **2017** as part of his ongoing exploration into sound, tuning, and interactive music technology. Paine has a background in both music composition and software development, which he combines here to push the boundaries of digital music making. WebSynths is an open-ended project, demonstrating Paine's commitment to making advanced sound technology accessible to a wide audience.

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Built with JavaScript and Web Audio API**: WebSynths leverages the Web Audio API, which allows for real-time sound synthesis directly in the browser without any need for plugins or downloads. This makes it a versatile tool for on-the-go exploration and learning.
- **Microtonal Tunings with .scl Support**: WebSynths Microtonal supports the `.scl` (Scala) tuning format, a widely-used format for microtonal scales, allowing users to import custom scales from the Scala library or create their own. This flexibility is invaluable for composers and sound designers interested in specific or rare tuning systems.
- **Real-time Synthesis and Sound Design**: The app provides multiple synthesis engines, including additive, subtractive, and FM synthesis, which give users the ability to craft unique timbres that complement the unconventional tunings.
  
**Features and Highlights:**

- **Microtonal Tunings**: WebSynths Microtonal lets you explore non-traditional scales, from quarter-tones to exotic tuning systems that are rarely heard in mainstream music.
- **Intuitive Interface**: The interface is clean and web-based, meaning no installations are necessary. Just open the browser, and you’re ready to create.
- **Sound Exploration**: With a variety of synthesis options, WebSynths allows users to design sounds that match the unique pitches they’re working with, fostering a rich and customizable sound experience.

This app represents a unique blend of music and technology, opening the door to new creative possibilities for musicians, producers, and audio explorers alike. It's a fantastic resource to keep bookmarked for those interested in experimenting with sound on the microtonal spectrum.
