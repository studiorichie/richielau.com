Welcome to my digital space! I’m Richie Lau, and I created this site as a hub to showcase projects, share insights, and dive into the crossroads of technology, music, and urban culture.

### What to Expect Here

Through this blog, I’ll be exploring:
- **Creative Projects**: Sharing my experiments and projects, especially those that blend music, urban transit data, and innovative design.
- **Tech in Urban Spaces**: How technology transforms city life, from commute experiences to creative displays in public spaces.
- **Music and Code**: Writing about the ways code and music influence each other, and how we can bring the two closer through interactive experiences.

### Latest Project: TrackStar

One of my recent projects, **TrackStar**, is all about transforming the urban commute through location-based music experiences. Imagine a soundtrack that evolves with your journey, making city life feel more immersive and personalized. I’ll be documenting TrackStar’s development here, along with insights on building tech that resonates with the rhythms of urban life.

### About This Site

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which powers many static websites. I customized it with a simple, clean look to keep the focus on the content and the projects. 

### Join Me on the Journey

Check back for updates, new projects, and posts about the ever-evolving interplay of code, music, and the city. I’d love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and feedback as I continue to build this space.

Until next time, stay inspired and keep exploring!
