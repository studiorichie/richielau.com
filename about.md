# Richie Lau
Welcome to my digital domain. I’m Richie Lau, the mind behind StudioRich—a hub for urban innovation where tech, design, and city culture intersect. As a developer, designer, and creator, I’m driven by the idea of making technology that doesn’t just live on screens but resonates with the rhythms of the streets.

## My Journey
From web development roots to founding StudioRich, I’ve been blending design with tech to create experiences that connect. Each project is about turning everyday interactions into something immersive, something that feels as alive as the city itself. StudioRich is where I bring this vision to life, exploring how tech can become part of urban culture, shaping everything from transit data to interactive street art.

## Projects
At StudioRich, it’s all about blending art with function, code with culture. Check out some of our standout projects:

- **TrackStar**: Location-based playlists meet real-time transit data, transforming commutes into curated audio experiences.
- **Urban Visualizer**: A dynamic look at transit data in real-time, turning city movements into a digital mural.
- **Interactive Street Art**: Merging graffiti with digital media, this project brings the walls to life, adding layers of story to every surface.
