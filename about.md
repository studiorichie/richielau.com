# Richie Lau
I’m Richie Lau, the mind behind StudioRich—an urban innovation lab where tech, design, and NYC culture collide. As a developer, designer, and creator, I’m driven by a vision to build technology that doesn’t just sit on screens but pulses with the energy of the city itself. StudioRich is about creating immersive experiences that bring the pulse of urban life into the digital world.


## My Journey
My path began with a passion for design—even in the early days of music promotion, creating flyers was something I loved. Designing felt like capturing the energy of a moment, a spark that naturally evolved as I moved into web development. Immersed in both worlds, I gained firsthand insight into how music and visuals connect people to the rhythm and pulse of urban life. It’s the intersection of tech and culture that drives me—creating digital experiences that mirror the life, rhythm, and spontaneity of the streets.

Today, with StudioRich, I’ve brought those creative roots and technical skills together to build immersive, culture-driven experiences that echo the city itself. Each project is a chance to explore where design and code intersect, creating spaces that feel as alive and dynamic as the streets they’re inspired by.


## Projects
At StudioRich, we’re all about merging art with functionality, code with culture. Here’s a glimpse at some of our key projects:

- `Trackstar`: Bringing the sounds of New York to life, Trackstar is a location-based music app that combines curated playlists with real-time transit data, transforming commutes into audio journeys through the city. Sign up at [trackstar.nyc](trackstar.nyc)
- `Urban Visualizer`: A live, dynamic view of transit data that turns city movements into digital murals—a tribute to the flow and pulse of urban life.
- `Interactive Street Art`: A fusion of graffiti and digital media, adding depth to city walls and telling stories with every surface.
- `Hello, My Name Is... Sticker App`: A fun, customizable digital sticker tool that lets you design and share your own “Hello, My Name Is…” stickers. Try it out and explore more on [StudioRich](https://studiorich.shop).
